# stock-statistics

This is a Python app, which calculates basic statistical parameters of a stock (index). The data is read as a CSV file (historical data can be downloaded online, e.g. Yahoo Finance).


**Implemented features**
* all time high
* ratio of days with price increase and days with price decrease
* maximum of price increasing/decreasing days in a row


**Ideas**
* filter by dates
* detect n days in a row and trend (higher lower ratio) for the day after
